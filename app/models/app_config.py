"""Single-row system configuration (one row, fixed primary key of 1).

Holds operational settings an admin can change from the UI without redeploying —
currently just the audit/activity log retention window. See
app.services.system_config for the read-side cache and accessors.

The initial value, when the row is first created, comes from the
HRSOT_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS env var (settings.audit_retention_days), so a build
can still set a starting default; the UI value then persists and overrides it.
